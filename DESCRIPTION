Description: 'R' interface to nonlinear least-squares optimization with the GNU Scientific Library (GSL). The available trust region methods include the Levenberg-Marquadt algorithm with and without geodesic acceleration, and several variants of Powell's dogleg algorithm. Bindings are provided to tune a number of parameters affecting the low-level aspects of the trust region algorithms. The interface mimics 'R''s nls() function and returns model objects inheriting from the same class.
