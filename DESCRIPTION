Description: An R interface to nonlinear least-squares optimization with the GNU Scientific Library (GSL), see M. Galassi et al. (2009, ISBN:0954612078). The available trust region methods include the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with and without geodesic acceleration, the Steihaug-Toint conjugate gradient algorithm for large systems and several variants of Powell's dogleg algorithm. Bindings are provided to tune a number of parameters affecting the low-level aspects of the trust region algorithms. The interface mimics R's nls() function and returns model objects inheriting from the same class.
